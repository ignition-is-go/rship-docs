# Ableton Live

Ableton Live integrates with Rocketship using a Max for Live device and a sidecar application in tandem.

The Max for Live Device can be added to any track in the set, and recursively iterates through the Live Object Model to surface the Targets, Actions, and Emitters of the live set.

The sidecar application runs separately and bridges the connection between Ableton Live and Rocketship.

## Installation

**Rship Device**

Download the 'rship' M4L device and add it to any track in the live set.

**Sidecar App**

Download the 'Rship-Ableton' sidecar app and run it. Enter the address and port of a Rocketship server and connect.
