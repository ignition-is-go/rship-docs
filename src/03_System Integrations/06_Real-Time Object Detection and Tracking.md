Dataflow:

Find the intersection points between the ground plane(s) and the objects

- Installation: Camera array
	- Objective: Extrapolate object location data from multiple camera perspectives
		- OpenCV locates cameras in 3D space
- Computer vision models
	- Output object detection/tracking information
- Rocketship
	- Orchestrate event relationships using tracking information as Emitter data
	- Modify tracking regions as Actions (?)

- Broadcast: Witness camera on top of broadcast camera
	- Looking at talent/the view of the stage
