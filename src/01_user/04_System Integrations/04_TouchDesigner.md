# Touch Designer

1. Download the RshipTouchdesignerExec.tox from GitHub Releases
2. Â Import the .tox into your TouchDesigner project.
3. Add an 'rship' label to every BaseCOMP you wish to appear in Rocketship as a Target. Verify the BaseCOMP appears as a Target in the Rocketship GUI.

	3. Identify the parameter in your TouchDesigner patch you wish to expose to Rocketship. 
		1. Right-click on the parameter and click 'Copy Parameter'
		2. Navigate back to the 'rship'-labeled BaseCOMP, right-click on the custom parameter you just created, and choose 'Paste Bind'
6. Save the file :)
7. Verify that the custom parameter appears in the Rocketship GUI as a SubTarget. 
8. To export the output of a node to a custom parameter, activate the node, drag it to the parameter name, and choose 'Export'.

**NOTE: If Targets/SubTargets are not appearing in Rocketship, navigate to the 'rship' BaseCOMP and pulse Reconnect.**
