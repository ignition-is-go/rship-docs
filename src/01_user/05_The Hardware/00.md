# The Hardware

The creative potential of Rocketship can be further unlocked using dedicated hardware. Hardware defines what is physically possible, so the hardware that a Rocketship server runs on defines, to some extent, the possible complexity of the projects that Rocketship can create.

# SPECS

**Build 1**
- Graphics
	- 4 RTX 6000 Ada's
- Network switch
	- NVIDIA Mellanox MCX623106AN-CDAT ConnectXÂ®-6 Dx EN Network Interface Card, 100GbE Dual-Port QSFP56, PCIe4.0 x 16, Tall&Short Bracket
		- https://www.fs.com/products/119646.html
- CPU
	- AMD Epyc 
		- https://www.amd.com/en/processors/epyc-7003-series

Putting these together yields:

## Capabilities

- Flexibility
	- Do more different shit
- Scalability
- Rack size is reduced; rendering power is increased

- Manage




- LiveOS
	- Software package suite for broadcast running as a web server
	- Clean Switching
		- SDI signals (digital information encoded in RF frequencies running over coax cables)
		- SDI encodes frame-timing information via synchronization points @60fps
		- Genlock is a system for dealing with JUST those sync markers
	- Converting 
	- PTP
		- Time-determined packet insertion
