# Getting Started

> NOTE: This guide assumes you have systems set up and connected to Rocketship. For more information on that process, see [Connecting Systems to Rocketship](./06_Connecting%20Systems%20to%20Rocketship.md)

## Hello, Rocketship!

The core functionality of Rocketship can be achieved in just a few simple steps:

1. Open a Chromium-based web browser, navigate to the address of a Rocketship server, and select or create a new Project
2. Open the Scenes page and drag an Emitter and an Action from the Targets list onto the Scene Graph
3. Connect the Emitter to the Action to create a Binding
4. Activate the Scene to make the Binding live

And that's it! You've designed your first realtime reactive event relationship by creating a simple Binding between an Emitter and an Action, encapsulating that Binding within a Scene, and activating the Scene to make the Binding live.

## Next Steps

Immersive experiences are made up of many relationships, both simple and complex, between lots of different systems, and make use of additional features for managing and orchestrating how an immersive experience unfolds. 

Maybe you want to have lots of Scenes that encapsulate different sets of reactive event relationships, like moments in a live show or modes of an installation?    
See [Managing Scenes](./02_Managing%20Scenes.md).

Maybe you want to control how Scenes evolve over time, and schedule them on a calendar?    
See [Managing Time](./03_Managing%20Time.md).

Maybe you want to separate 'pre-viz', 'rehearsal', and 'live' versions of your project?    
See [Managing Sessions](./04_Managing%20Sessions.md).

Maybe you want to scope access and permissions for individuals and teams?    
See [Managing Projects](./05_Managing%20Projects.md)
