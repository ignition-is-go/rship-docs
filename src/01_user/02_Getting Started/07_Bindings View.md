# Bindings

Similar to **Bundles** view, **Bindings** view contains a left-hand sidebar, this time with a list of **Emitters**. There is also a right-hand sidebar, where you should ==see the **Bundle** you just created (N.B. If a bundle is selected, it shows up in 'selected', but that's a bit confusing when you also see a 'bundles' category).==

Expand the **Target** structure until you find an **Emitter**. Notice that the **Emitter** card has a small heartbeat icon - whenever an **Emitter** sends a **Pulse** to Rocketship, its icon flashes. 

Click and drag an **Emitter** onto a **Bundle**. This will create a **Simple Binding** in the middle column. ==Here, you can view and edit basic information about a **Simple Binding** (N.B. Currently, when I create a Binding, the drop-down reveals nothing. And going forward: What information? What constitutes a Simple Binding, and how are they different from **Complex Bindings**? Could creating a Simple Binding auto-create a basic Node Graph?).==
