# Managing Time

Scenes can optionally have one or many **Event Tracks**, which hold keyframes that modify properties of Nodes in the Scene Graph as the Event Track unfolds in 'local' time (relative to the Scene).

Scenes can also optionally be added to the **Calendar**, which defines when they are activated and deactivated in 'global' time.
