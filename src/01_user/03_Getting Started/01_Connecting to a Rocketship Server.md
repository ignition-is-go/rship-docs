# Connecting to Rocketship

We first need to connect a web browser to a Rocketship Server in order to load the Web GUI. Open up your favorite browser and navigate to the host IP address of the server you wish to connect to. 

Rocketship will ask you to authenticate yourself. In addition to security, this step also serves as a permissions mechanism for collaborative work.
