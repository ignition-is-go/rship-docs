# Foreword

Our experience of the world can be thought of as an accumulated perception of the effects of reactive event relationships taking place around us. From interactions between subatomic particles to relationships between concepts and ideas, our very temporal and spatial existence can be considered in these terms. 

Science and Engineering provide increasingly precise instruments for manipulating reactive event relationships, while Mathematics and Philosophy delve ever deeper into the fundamental principles of language, concept, and logic. Concurrently, Art and Design continue to push the boundaries of creative possibility space and idea.

It is possible for us to perceive the effects of reactive event relationships both as observers and/or as participants, and our perception can be more or less conscious.  

It is also possible for us to exert control over how reactive event relationships unfold, both as designers (by defining parameters) and/or as interactors (by influencing parameters).

Fundamentally, Rocketship exists to facilitate the process of creating and surfacing information about the reactive event relationships taking place in complex, dynamic, real-time, multi-domain integrated systems at scale. 

## Rocketship was invented so that Nick Fletcher never had to deal with DMX ever again.

The above statements are intentionally abstract, because Rocketship is made to work at that level of abstraction; however, the idea of Rocketship was initially born in reaction (ha!) to existing paradigms of show control software. 

To put it bluntly, existing show control software makes working with reactive event relationships within a network of *multi-domain* subsystems either a major pain in the ass, or impossibly difficult and fragile to engineer - not to mention doing so *at scale*. This is largely a knock-on effect of using existing show data protocols such as Timecode, Art-Net, OSC, MIDI (sorry, even MIDI 2.0!). 

Designed for simpler times, these protocols are often ill-suited to the demands of highly interactive and dynamic environments. The difficulty in working with these protocols is also amplified exponentionally when multiple different protocols must be coordinated in order to produce an interactive effect, which wouldn't feel so bad if it weren't for the fact that the technical engineering is rarely re-usable, meaning every project requires a bespoke solution. 

The real devil of it is that the harder something is to build and the more fragile its construction, the less flexible it is to change, and so not only do rigid and unaccomodating protocols raise the engineer's blood pressure, it also reduces the freedom with which the designer can navigate the creative possibility space provided by the technology (which is the whole point of creative techology in the first place, leveraging technology to realize something new and different).

So to make a long story short, after years of struggling to produce the kinds of immersive experiences he envisioned within the existing show control paradigm, Nick Fletcher said "fuck that" (as he often does) and so began Rocketship.

## "The value is only realized when people can see a difference" (some creative designer guru somewhere)

6 years later, the first big win for Rocketship is that it isn't hard to set up reactive event relationships anymore. That means we can do it faster and iterate a lot more, and we don't have to be afraid of thinking about complicated interactive effects because technically they aren't difficult to implement.

And while reducing this lift is indeed valuable and important, it is not enough for us only to do the same thing in a more effective way - we want to do something entirely different and new, something which has never before existed because the tools for making it didn't exist. 

But what makes something different? It's about the feeling you get when you enter a space, and that space is a living, organic thing, and you discover a design narrative that emerges from the confluence of reactive event relationships taking place, and you can not only observe those relationships but influence them as well, interact with the space and participate in the emergent narrative.
