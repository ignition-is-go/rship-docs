# Foreword

We can think about our experience of the world as an accumulated perception of the effects of reactive event relationships taking place around us. From fundamental interactions between subatomic particles to abstract relationships between concepts and ideas, our very temporal and spatial existence can be considered in these terms. 

Science and Engineering provide us with increasingly precise instruments for observing and manipulating reactive event relationships, while Mathematics and Philosophy continue to delve deeper into the fundamental relational principles of language, concept, and logic - as well as Art and Design, which continue to broaden our horizons of creative possibility space and idea.

It is possible for us to perceive the effects of these reactive event relationships, both as observers and/or as participants, and our perception of them can be more or less conscious. By simply existing in the world, we automatically become participatants in a hugely complex and multidimensional universe unfolding in time - and by interacting with the world, we can influence what takes place in it. 

Rocketship was conceived principally through the lens of show production, and thus it focuses on how we can exert control over how reactive event relationships unfold around us, both as designers (by defining relationships and parameters) and/or as interactors (by influencing parameters). It exists to facilitate the process of creating and surfacing information about the reactive event relationships which take place in complex, dynamic, real-time, multi-domain integrated systems at scale. 

Fundamentally, Rocketship's main goal is to address two challenges in creative technology and system engineering: 1) That the technical infrastructure which enables reactive event relationships is often difficult and obscure to create, brittle, and difficult to maintin; and 2) That this technical burden impedes the process of design iteration and greatly limits how freely we can navigate creative possibility space.

Rocketship is designed to take all of the abstraction layers surrounding reactive event relationships outlined above, express them in an intuitive language, and provide technical infrastructure and UI tooling which makes setting up and working with them feel easy and natural.

## Rocketship was invented so that Nick Fletcher never had to deal with DMX ever again

To put it bluntly, existing show control software makes working with reactive event relationships within a network of *multi-domain* subsystems either a major pain in the ass, or impossibly difficult and fragile to engineer - not to mention doing so *at scale*. This is largely a knock-on effect of using existing show data protocols such as Timecode, Art-Net, OSC, or MIDI (sorry, even MIDI 2.0!). 

Designed for simpler times, these protocols are often ill-suited to the demands of highly interactive and dynamic environments. The difficulty in working with these protocols is also amplified exponentionally when multiple different protocols must be coordinated in order to produce an interactive effect, which wouldn't feel so bad if it weren't for the fact that the technical engineering is rarely re-usable, meaning every project requires a bespoke solution. 

But the real devil of it is that the harder something is to build and the more fragile its construction, the less flexible it is to change, and so not only do rigid and unaccomodating protocols raise the engineer's blood pressure, they also reduces the freedom with which the designer can navigate the creative possibility space provided by the technology (which is the whole point of creative techology in the first place, to leverage technology in realizing something new and different).

So to make a long story short, after years of struggling to produce the kinds of immersive experiences he envisioned within the existing paradigm of show control, Nick Fletcher said "fuck that" (as he often does) and so Rocketship was born.

## "The value is only realized when people can see a difference" (some creative designer guru somewhere)

6 years later, the first big win for Rocketship is that it isn't hard to set up reactive event relationships anymore. That means we can do it faster and iterate a lot more, and we don't have to be afraid of thinking about complicated interactive effects because technically they aren't difficult to implement.

And while reducing this lift is indeed valuable and important, it is not enough for us only to do the same thing in a more effective way - we want to do something entirely different and new, something which has never before existed because the tools for making it didn't yet exist. 

But what makes something different? To us, it's about the feeling you get when you enter into a space, and realize that space is a living, organic thing, and you start to discover a design narrative that emerges from the confluence of reactive event relationships taking place around you, and you can not only observe those relationships but influence them as well, and start to interact with the space as a participant in the emergent narrative you suddenly realize you have become a part of.
