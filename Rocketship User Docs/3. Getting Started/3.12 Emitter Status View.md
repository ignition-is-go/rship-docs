**Emitter Status** view illustrates the **Pulse** activity of **Emitters**. Similar to **Bundles** and **Bindings** view, **Emitters** are grouped by **Targets**. 

The collapsed **Emitter** graph simply plots a point whenever that **Emitter** fires a **Pulse**. 

The expanded **Emitter** graph, on the other hand, plots the *data value* of each **Pulse** over time.
