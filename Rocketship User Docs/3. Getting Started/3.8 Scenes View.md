In **Scenes** view, you can create and edit different **Scenes**.

Editing a **Scene** brings you to its **Node Graph** and **Timeline**.

A Scene encapsulates a creative idea. Scenes are where you bring in Actions, Emitters, and other Nodes to the Node Graph in order to define how the relationships of that scene will unfold.

When the Scene is active, the bindings inside of it also become active. **Bindings are not active unless a Scene is active.** 

Scenes can have one or many asynchronously running Timelines, or no Timelines at all.

A Timeline is where you can sequence keyframes that set values and call functions of Nodes in the Scene.

A Scene gets placed in real time in the [[3.11 Scheduling](Scheduling View)]
