**Bundles** view contains a sidebar with a ==searchable and filterable (N.B. Add sorting functionality?) list of **Actions**, grouped by their respective **Targets** and **SubTargets**.== 

Create a **Bundle** and drag an **Action** into it. **Bundles** may be populated with any number of **Actions**. ==You can edit the data type of each action (N.B. Need to go over the information on each action card - what else can be edited? What datatype should be chosen? Why is the string field editable?).==

Make sure to ==save the **Bundle** (N.B. Make the save button larger/more obvious/labeled). You can manually Arm/Disarm and Send the **Bundle**.==

==(N.B. Since we are nixing the 3d view, **Bundles** view needs a way to manage and select different **Bundles**)==
