Don't worry if the **Dashboard** looks a bit empty - it's a running joke that Rocketship doesn't do anything. Rocketship populates its GUI based on the systems that are registered with it, so we need to connect at least one system (see [[Registering an Executor]]) in order for the GUI to emerge.

Dashboard components:
- Currently active scenes
- Total # of targets/emitters
- Total # of pulses per second
- List of scenes
	- Activate/deactivate scenes manually
