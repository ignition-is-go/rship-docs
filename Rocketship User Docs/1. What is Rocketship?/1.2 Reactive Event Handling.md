**Events** are the state changes of a system that Rocketship can detect and/or trigger: any event in any system can trigger or be triggered by any other event in any other system. Rocketship uses **Events** as the creative building blocks of reactive relationships, thus allowing creators to form intricate cascading chains of reactions between different systems.
