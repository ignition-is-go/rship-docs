# Classes of Reactive Event Relationships

After determining the events involved in a relationship, it remains to consider the nature of the relationship itself, which is largely informed by its class:

1. **Causal Relationships:** These are the most direct and straightforward relationships, and occur when a state change in one subsystem (the cause) triggers a state change in another subsystem (the effect).
2. **Self-Referential Relationships:** A relationship is considered self-referential when the state change of a subsystem triggers a state change in the same subsystem.
3. **Reciprocal Relationships:** In a reciprocal relationship, a state change in one subsystem triggers a state change in another, which in turn triggers a state change in the initial subsystem.

Both self-referential and reciprocal relationships can give rise to positive (amplification) and negative (stabilization) feedback loops, whereby a state change leads to more or less of the same change.

4. **Multidirectional Relationships:** In a Multidirectional Relationship, a single subsystem impacts and is impacted by multiple other subsystems, creating a complex and interconnected network of influence.
5. **Hierarchical/Ordered Relationships**: These are formed when multiple causal relationships are structured in a hierarchical order.
6. **Cross-Domain Relationships**: Cross-domain relationships span different types or domains of subsystems.
7. **Dynamic Relationships:** In a Dynamic Relationship, the nature of the relationship itself evolves over time. Dynamic Relationships can demonstrate adaptation and learning, responsiveness to environmental context, and even emergent behavior.

Relationships can certainly be of multiple classes at once

From a creative design perspective, these classes offer choices for determining the basic form of a reactive event relationship. They can also be used to retrospectively describe and organize reactive event relationships conceived intuitively.
