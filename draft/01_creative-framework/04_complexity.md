# Complexity

In the context of Rocketship, the notion of complexity exists at many levels:

1. **System Complexity:** This refers to the complexity of ==the entire network of subsystems== (i.e., the "whole system"), and is influenced by the number, type, and diversity of mediums of the various subsystems.

2. **Subsystem Complexity:** This refers to the complexity of ==each individual subsystem== within the network. It is influenced by factors such as the internal logic and structure of the subsystem, as well as the number and diversity of **Emitters** and **Actions** it registers.

3. **Reactive Event Relationship Complexity:** This refers to the complexity of ==a specific reactive event relationship== within the Rocketship system. Factors influencing this kind of complexity include:

	- **Emitter Complexity:** The variety of Emitter types that can initiate a reactive relationship. A system where a multitude of different Emitters can trigger reactions has a higher Emitter complexity.
    
	- **Action Complexity:** The variety and intricacy of potential Actions in response to a given Emitter. A system that can generate a wide array of Actions in response to an Emitter exhibits high Action complexity.
    
	- **Algorithmic Complexity:** The complexity of the rules or logic that determine the Action in response to an Emitter. If the set of rules governing Actions is intricate or has many conditional statements, the system displays high rule complexity.
	
	- **Relational Complexity:** The complexity determined by the type and variety of a reactive event relationship.

4. **Dynamic Complexity:** This type of complexity pertains to ==the unpredictability and changeability of a reactive event relationship that evolves over time==. Dynamic complexity can manifest in the form of cyclical changes, trends, or abrupt shifts in the reactive event relationship's dynamic. A reactive event relationship that adapts over time to user behavior or external conditions would demonstrate higher dynamic complexity.
    
5. **Informational Complexity:** Informational complexity in a reactive event relationship refers to ==the quantity and diversity of data processed by the relationship==. The more varied and voluminous the information considered, the higher the informational complexity.

It's also worth considering how different levels of complexity interact with one another. In a directly proportional manner, an increase in Subsystem Complexity would lead to an increase in System Complexity; however, a system could have high complexity due to a multitude of subsystems, each with their own multitude of Emitters and Actions, yet the reactive event relationships themselves might be simple and straightforward; and conversely, a system might consist of only a few subsystems, but if the reactive event relationships within it are highly complex, it could lead to a significant amount of complexity in terms of understanding or predicting system behavior.

In addition, there exists an important distinction between **Potential Complexity** and **Realized Complexity:**

- **Potential Complexity:** This refers to ==the theoretical maximum complexity that the system could generate==. It is dictated by the system's configuration: the number and type of Emitters and Actions, the complexity of the rules governing their interaction, the number of subsystems involved, and so on. However, because the activation of a reactive event relationship depends on the occurrence of certain events (which may be probabilistic or dependent on external inputs), not all of this complexity might be observed in reality.
    
- **Realized Complexity:** This refers to ==the complexity that is actually observed during the operation of the system==. It depends on which events occur, which reactive event relationships are activated, and the specific ways in which these relationships interact. It may be substantially lower than the potential complexity if only a subset of the possible events occur, or if the events that do occur activate relatively simple reactive event relationships.

Types of reactive event relationships are varyingly complex, and each relationship may also simultaneously be of multiple types. Considering these factors introduces the even higher-order concept of **'Relational Complexity'**. For example, a causal relationship is the least complex kind of relationship, whereas a hierarchical relationship can be as complex as the hierarchical structure itself determines; and a relationship that is simultaneously co-evolutionary *and* multi-directional expresses a greater degree of complexity than would a relationship that is solely either co-evolutionary *or* multi-directional.

We might also ask: To what extent is the complexity of a reactive event relationship perceptible to an observer? The notion of **'Perceptual Complexity'** is determined by a number of factors:

1. **Awareness:** This refers to the degree to which an observer is aware of a reactive event relationship, i.e., whether they can identify the existence of a link between an Emitter and an Action. ==From the perspective of a **Rocketship Operator**, conscious manipulation of the spectrum of Awareness, i.e., conscious awareness of Awareness, is a crucial aspect of creating reactive event relationships.== This Awareness may be influenced by:
    
    - **Transparency:** How clear is the link between the Emitter and the Action? In some cases, an Action might follow an Emitter so closely that the relationship is immediately obvious. In other cases, there may be a delay, or the relationship may be obscured by other factors, making it less obvious.
        
    - **Familiarity:** How familiar is the observer with the underlying system logic? A system operator would inherently understand the relationships they have created, whereas an outside observer would not.
        
2. **Comprehension:** This refers to the observer's ability to understand the underlying logic or rules governing a reactive event relationship. They might be aware of a reactive event relationship, but not understand why it occurs or what governs it. This might be influenced by:
    
    - **Intrinsic complexity:** How complex are the underlying rules or logic? If the relationship between an Emitter and an Action is governed by intricate or multi-step rules, it may be more difficult for an observer to interpret.
    
    - **Knowledge Gap:** This refers to the difference between an observer's existing understanding of the system, and the understanding required to fully grasp the logic or rules that govern the reactive event relationship. This gap could exist due to lack of exposure, limited information, or other reasons that hinder the observer's comprehension of the underlying mechanisms of the system. The larger the gap, the more challenging it may be for the observer to interpret the relationship, thereby increasing its Perceptual Complexity.

In summary, the complexity of a Rocketship-powered system manifests across multiple dimensions. System and Subsystem Complexity look at the breadth and depth of the reactive elements present, while Reactive Event Relationship Complexity, Dynamic Complexity, and Informational Complexity focus on the nature of the interactions and transformations that occur within the system. Furthermore, the distinctions between Potential and Realized Complexity help delineate between the theoretical and realistic manifestations of complexity. Meanwhile, Perceptual Complexity provides a lens through which to consider the observer's understanding and awareness of a system's complexity. These facets of complexity are far from isolated, often intersecting and interacting with each other, and contribute to the emergent behavior of a Rocketship-powered system. By gaining an understanding of these different dimensions of complexity, a **Rocketship Operator** is better equipped to analyze, design, and manage such systems with a fuller awareness of their possible behaviors, limitations, and opportunities.
