## Creating a project.

After authenticating, you will be greeted by the project page. 

Create a new project or select an existing project.

Create and name a new project. 

Data from systems connected with Rocketship (**Targets**, **Emitters**, etc.) persist between different projects, but anything you create within Rocketship (**Bundles**, **Bindings**, **Scenes**, etc.) is saved in the active project. 

Click on a project name to edit it.
