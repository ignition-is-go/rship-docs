# Node Graphs

Rocketship's **Node Graph** enables more fine-grained control over reactive event relationships.

Drag an **Emitter** and an **Action** from the sidebar onto the canvas. You will notice that an **Emitter** has one outlet, and an **Action** has one inlet. The shapes of the outlets and inlets determine valid connections between [[2.6 Nodes]].

Connect an **Emitter** to an **Action** to create a **Simple Binding**, then click 'Compile' to save the **Node Graph**.
