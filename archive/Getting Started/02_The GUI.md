# The Gui

Upon loading a project, you will see a navigation bar listing Rocketship's various pages: 

- [Projects] 
- [Calendar]
- [Configs]
- [Bundles]
- [Bindings]
- [Scenes]
- [Status]

Since Rocketship runs in a web browser you can duplicate the GUI in new windows, rearrange, and resize those windows as much as you'd like. We recommend dedicating at least two monitors towards operating Rocketship so that you can have a few different pages open at once.

At the bottom of the page lies a footer which lists the current [[version]], as well as the active [[config]] and [[session]] number. A single session may contain multiple configs.

You can view multiple configs at once by opening multiple windows - the color-coded footers will help you keep track of which windows correspond to which configs.
