## Connecting to a Rocketship Server

In order to access the monitoring and control interface for setting up and orchestrating reactive event relationships between different Executors, connect to a Rocketship Server in a web browser to load the GUI. Open up your favorite browser (we recommend using Chrome) and navigate to the host address of the server you wish to connect to. 

Being able to load the control GUI of any Rocketship Server from a browser client is part of the decentralized nature of Rocketship, and automatically enables many useful features. You can open as many copies of the client in as many windows or tabs you would like, from any computer on the same network as the server. This makes window management and multi-user editing inherent and intuitive, and allows everybody working on a project to view and/or edit the same monitoring/control interface.
